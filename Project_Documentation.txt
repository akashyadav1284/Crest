                                PROJECT DOCUMENTATION
================================================================================

1. INTRODUCTION & BEGINNING
We started this project from scratch to build a futuristic, "Cyberpunk" themed 
Event Management Website for the Crest Club. We wanted a seamless experience 
for users to explore events and register for large-scale hackathons.

2. INITIAL SETUP
The project was split into two main parts:
- A "frontend" folder for the user interface.
- A "backend" folder for the server and database handling.

3. TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES
- Frontend: 
  - Next.js (React Framework for structure and routing)
  - Tailwind CSS (For styling the neon/hacker aesthetic)
  - Framer Motion (For smooth animations and hover effects)
- Backend:
  - Node.js & Express.js (To build our own custom API)
- Database:
  - MongoDB (To store all the team registrations securely)

4. FOLDER STRUCTURE
/frontend
  └─ /src
      └─ /app
          └─ /hackathons       <- Pages for event listing and registration flow
      └─ /components           <- Reusable blocks like Navbars and Cards
/backend
  └─ /models                   <- Database schemas (how data should look)
  └─ /routes                   <- API endpoints (how the frontend talks to the DB)
  └─ server.js                 <- The main engine running the backend

5. FRONTEND UI DESIGN
We used a Dark Theme with "Glassmorphism" (translucent cards) and Neon 
Blue/Magenta glows. The UI is broken into:
- Listing Page: Cards showing available hackathons.
- Details Page: Shows Event Dates, Venues, Sponsors, and Rulebook.
- Registration Form: A sleek console-style form to enter team details.

6. HACKATHON REGISTRATION FORM
When a user clicks "Register Your Team", they are taken to a dedicated page 
that asks for all their credentials to securely lock in their spot.

7. USER DETAILS COLLECTED
The form captures:
- Full Name (Leader)
- Registration Number
- Course / Major
- Year of Study
- Email & Phone Number
- Team Name & Team Members Count

8. SENDING DATA TO BACKEND
When the user clicks "Save Details", the Next.js frontend packages all those 
inputs into a JSON object and sends an HTTP POST request to our Custom API
running at `http://localhost:5000/api/hackathons/register`.

9. MONGODB CONNECTION
The backend runs a library called 'Mongoose'. When it receives the team data,
Mongoose checks it against our `HackTeamSchema` to ensure no fields are missing, 
and then securely connects to the local MongoDB database to save it.

10. DATABASE STORAGE
The data is successfully saved into a database named `crestDB`. Inside of that 
database, there is a specific collection (like a spreadsheet tab) named 
`hackteams` where every single registration is stored as a document.

11. VIEWING DATA IN MONGODB COMPASS
As the event organizer, you open the MongoDB Compass application on your PC, 
connect to `localhost:27017`, open `crestDB`, and click on `hackteams`. Here 
you can visually see and manage every single registered team in real-time!

12. PAYMENT INTEGRATION
After the data is saved, the user is automatically redirected to a Dummy 
Payment Gateway. It shows their Order Summary and lets them "pretend" to pay 
via UPI QR Code or Credit Card. Once they click 'Proceed', the backend updates 
their database status from 'pending' to 'completed', and the user gets a 
beautiful Digital Ticket Page.

13. FULL WORKING FLOW
User browses Events -> Clicks Register -> Fills Form -> Frontend sends to 
Backend -> Backend saves to MongoDB -> User goes to Payment -> Backend marks 
as Paid -> User downloads Digital Ticket.

14. HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT LOCALLY
To run the full stack system on a computer:
- Open Terminal 1:
  cd backend
  node server.js
- Open Terminal 2:
  cd frontend
  npm install
  npm run dev
- Launch MongoDB Server locally.
- Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
